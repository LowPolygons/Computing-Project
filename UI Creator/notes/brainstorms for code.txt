a table can be made in a seperate file and it just logs everything to a portion of the screen , useful for things such as screen flags

By drawing things that do not change position often (such as background items) to the Canvas, and then drawing the entire Canvas instead of each item, you can reduce the number of draw operations performed each frame.
crucial for efficiency

how can this be made so that for now it doesnt need a gui but later it can be modified via gui?
have it entirely depend on a table with just boolean or integer values
similar to the screen flags however a potentially more varied list of things

current screen flags:

resizable ; bool
centered ; bool
highdpi ; bool
usedpiscale ; bool
stencil ; bool
depth ; int
x ; int
y ; int
minwidth ; int
maxwidth ; int
fullscreen ; bool
fullscreentype ; choice of strings
refreshrate ; int
display ; int
vsync ; 1/0
msaa ; 0/1
borderless ; bool

of these how many should actually be used should change

have be in fullscreen initially
